## Technical details
In the Word Association Game, users are presented with a prompt word and are given a short amount of time (usually five seconds) to come up with another word that is related to the prompt word. The game is designed to be fast-paced and interactive, and users are encouraged to use their own knowledge and creativity to come up with unique and interesting word associations.

From a technical perspective, the game requires real-time processing of user inputs and the generation of new prompt words based on the user's responses. It also includes a scoring system that awards points to users for coming up with words that are related to the prompt word. Additionally, the game requires a user interface that is easy to use and navigate, and that can handle the incoming and outgoing data in real-time.

## Story/Inspiration behind the project
Just as God had created the world with words, we as project engineers are believers in Christ Jesus and therefore believe in the creative abilities of words. Words have power to heal and give life to people. This is why we felt the need to touch peoples hearts through words.
